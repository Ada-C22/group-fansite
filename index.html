      <h2>City of Austin</h2>
      <p>Located in Central Texas on the eastern edge of the American Southwest, Austin is the capital of the state of Texas, the Lone Star State. The city dates back to the 1830s, when the first Anglo-American settlers arrived in the area, then part of Mexico. In 1837, settlers founded the village of Waterloo on the banks of the Colorado River, the first permanent settlement in the area. By 1839, Waterloo would adopt the name Austin and the frontier town would become the capital of the Republic of Texas. The City is named for Stephen F. Austin, the “Father of Texas.”</p>
